Disease Name: Cataracts
Cause: Cataracts occur when the normally clear lens of the eye becomes cloudy. The exact cause is often related to aging and the natural breakdown of proteins in the lens. However, other factors can contribute to the development of cataracts, including long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, certain medical conditions (such as diabetes), injury to the eye, prolonged use of corticosteroid medications, and smoking.
Prevalence: Cataracts are a common age-related condition and a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness worldwide. The prevalence increases with age, and it is estimated that over half of all Americans will have developed cataracts or undergone cataract surgery by the age of 80.
Symptoms: Common symptoms of cataracts include:
Cloudy or blurry vision
Difficulty seeing at night or in low-light conditions
Sensitivity to glare from lights, such as headlights or sunlight
Colors appearing faded or yellowed
Double vision or multiple images in one eye
Frequent changes in eyeglass or contact lens prescription
Treatments: The only effective treatment for cataracts is surgical removal. Cataract surgery involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL). The surgery is typically performed on an outpatient basis and has a high success rate. Prior to surgery, eyeglasses or contact lenses may be prescribed to improve vision, and cataract-affected individuals are often advised to use proper lighting and magnifying devices to manage daily activities.
Prevention Measures: While cataracts cannot be completely prevented, the following measures may help reduce the risk or delay the onset:
Protecting the eyes from UV radiation: Wearing sunglasses that block UVA and UVB rays and a wide-brimmed hat when outdoors can help reduce the exposure to harmful UV radiation.
Quitting smoking: Smoking has been linked to an increased risk of developing cataracts, so quitting smoking or avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke is beneficial.
Managing underlying health conditions: Properly managing medical conditions such as diabetes and maintaining overall good health can help reduce the risk of cataracts.
Regular eye exams: Undergoing routine eye exams can help detect the early signs of cataracts and enable timely treatment or management strategies.
