# Medical-Disease-Information-Retrival-System

A Python based Medical Disease Information Retrieval System. It takes input the information related to the disease or issues you are facing and based upon best match with the relevant disease, it returns complete detail of the relevant disease. These details include symptoms, precaution, treatment, and Prevalence.


**Note:** It is not a perfect system so it is not recommended to rely only on it or follow it blindly, yet it is a good solution to help out people in finding which doctor they should consult or take precautions which can help them to avoid further loss in health. These precautions are not harmful.
